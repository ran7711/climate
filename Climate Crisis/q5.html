<h2> Are the land-based ice sheets in Greenland and Antarctica continuing to lose mass (ice)?</h2>


<pre>



    The mass of the Greenland ice sheet has rapidly declined in the last several years due to surface melting
    and iceberg calving. Between 2002 and 2016, Greenland shed approximately 280 gigatons of ice per year,
    causing global sea level to rise by 0.03 inches (0.8 millimeters) per year. In these images, orange
    and red shades indicate areas that lost ice mass, while light blue shades indicate areas that gained
    ice mass. White indicates areas where there has been very little or no change in ice mass since 2002
    Data from NASA's GRACE satellites, which measured Earthâ€™s gravity field, show that the land ice sheets
    in both Antarctica (first chart) and Greenland (second chart) have been losing mass (ice) since 2002.
    Both ice sheets have seen an acceleration of ice mass loss since 2009.

    The latest research shows that Antarctic ice sheet losses are further accelerating, tripling their contribution
    to global sea level rise since 2012.
