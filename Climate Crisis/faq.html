                    Overall, volcanoes release less than 2 percent of the equivalent amount of CO2 released by human activities.
                    Quite small. However, about once every 20 years there is a volcanic eruption (e.g., Mount Pinatubo, El Chichon)
                    that throws out a tremendous amount of particles and other gases. These will effectively shield us enough from
                    the Sun to lead to a period of global cooling. The particles and gases typically dissipate after about 2 years,
                    but the effect is nearly global.

                    Humans have caused major climate changes to happen already, and we have set in motion more changes still.
                    Even if we stopped emitting greenhouse gases today,
                    global warming would continue to happen for at least several more decades, if not centuries. That’s because
                    it takes a while for the planet (for example, the oceans)
                    to respond, and because carbon dioxide – the predominant heat-trapping gas – lingers in the atmosphere for
                    hundreds of years. There is a time lag between what we do and when we feel it.
                    In the absence of major action to reduce emissions, global temperature is on track to rise by an average of
                    6 °C (10.8 °F), according to the latest estimates. Some scientists argue
                    a “global disaster” is already unfolding at the poles of the planet; the Arctic, for example, may be
                    ice-free at the end of the summer melt season within just a few years.
                    Yet other experts are concerned about Earth passing one or more “tipping points” – abrupt, perhaps
                    irreversible changes that tip our climate into a new state.
                    But it may not be too late to avoid or limit some of the worst effects of climate change.
                    Responding to climate change will involve a two-tier approach:
                    1)  “mitigation” – reducing the flow of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere;
                    2)  “adaptation” – learning to live with, and adapt to, the climate change that has already been set in motion.
                    The key question is: what will our emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants be in the years to come?
                    Recycling and driving more fuel-efficient cars are examples of important behavioral change that will help,
                    but they will not be enough. Because climate change is a truly global, complex problem with economic, social,
                    political and moral ramifications,
                    the solution will require both a globally-coordinated response (such as international policies and agreements
                    between countries,
                    a push to cleaner forms of energy) and local efforts on the city- and regional-level (for example, public
                    transport upgrades, energy efficiency improvements,
                    sustainable city planning, etc.). It’s up to us what happens next.

                    yes, the vast majority of actively publishing climate scientists – 97 percent – agree that humans are
                    causing global warming and climate change. Most of the leading science organizations around the world
                    have issued public statements expressing this, including international and U.S. science academies,
                    the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and a whole host of reputable scientific
                    bodies around the world.

                            “Global warming” refers to the long-term warming of the planet. Global temperature shows a well-documented
                            rise since the early 20th century and most notably since the late 1970s. Worldwide, since 1880 the average
                            surface temperature has risen about 1 °C (about 2 °F), relative to the mid-20th-century baseline (of 1951-1980).
                            This is on top of about an additional 0.15 °C of warming from between 1750 and 1880.

                            “Climate change” encompasses global warming, but refers to the broader range of changes that are happening to our
                            planet. These include rising sea levels; shrinking mountain glaciers; accelerating ice melt in Greenland,
                            Antarctica and the Arctic; and shifts in flower/plant blooming times. These are all consequences of the warming,
                            which is caused mainly by people burning fossil fuels and putting out heat-trapping gases into the air.
                            The terms “global warming” and “climate change” are sometimes used interchangeably, but strictly they refer
                            to slightly different things.
