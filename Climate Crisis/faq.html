                    Overall, volcanoes release less than 2 percent of the equivalent amount of CO2 released by human
                    activities.
                    Quite small. However, about once every 20 years there is a volcanic eruption (e.g., Mount Pinatubo,
                    El Chichon)
                    that throws out a tremendous amount of particles and other gases. These will effectively shield us
                    enough from
                    the Sun to lead to a period of global cooling. The particles and gases typically dissipate after
                    about 2 years,
                    but the effect is nearly global.

                    Humans have caused major climate changes to happen already, and we have set in motion more changes
                    still.
                    Even if we stopped emitting greenhouse gases today,
                    global warming would continue to happen for at least several more decades, if not centuries. That’s
                    because
                    it takes a while for the planet (for example, the oceans)
                    to respond, and because carbon dioxide – the predominant heat-trapping gas – lingers in the
                    atmosphere for
                    hundreds of years. There is a time lag between what we do and when we feel it.
                    In the absence of major action to reduce emissions, global temperature is on track to rise by an
                    average of
                    6 °C (10.8 °F), according to the latest estimates. Some scientists argue
                    a “global disaster” is already unfolding at the poles of the planet; the Arctic, for example, may be
                    ice-free at the end of the summer melt season within just a few years.
                    Yet other experts are concerned about Earth passing one or more “tipping points” – abrupt, perhaps
                    irreversible changes that tip our climate into a new state.
                    But it may not be too late to avoid or limit some of the worst effects of climate change.
                    Responding to climate change will involve a two-tier approach:
                    1) “mitigation” – reducing the flow of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere;
                    2) “adaptation” – learning to live with, and adapt to, the climate change that has already been set
                    in motion.
                    The key question is: what will our emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants be in the years
                    to come?
                    Recycling and driving more fuel-efficient cars are examples of important behavioral change that will
                    help,
                    but they will not be enough. Because climate change is a truly global, complex problem with
                    economic, social,
                    political and moral ramifications,
                    the solution will require both a globally-coordinated response (such as international policies and
                    agreements
                    between countries,
                    a push to cleaner forms of energy) and local efforts on the city- and regional-level (for example,
                    public
                    transport upgrades, energy efficiency improvements,
                    sustainable city planning, etc.). It’s up to us what happens next.

                        “Global warming” refers to the long-term warming of the planet. Global temperature shows a
                        well-documented
                        rise since the early 20th century and most notably since the late 1970s. Worldwide, since 1880
                        the average
                        surface temperature has risen about 1 °C (about 2 °F), relative to the mid-20th-century baseline
                        (of 1951-1980).
                        This is on top of about an additional 0.15 °C of warming from between 1750 and 1880.

                        “Climate change” encompasses global warming, but refers to the broader range of changes that are
                        happening to our
                        planet. These include rising sea levels; shrinking mountain glaciers; accelerating ice melt in
                        Greenland,
                        Antarctica and the Arctic; and shifts in flower/plant blooming times. These are all consequences
                        of the warming,
                        which is caused mainly by people burning fossil fuels and putting out heat-trapping gases into
                        the air.
                        The terms “global warming” and “climate change” are sometimes used interchangeably, but strictly
                        they refer
                        to slightly different things.

                The mass of the Greenland ice sheet has rapidly declined in the last several years due to surface
                melting
                and iceberg calving. Between 2002 and 2016, Greenland shed approximately 280 gigatons of ice per year,
                causing global sea level to rise by 0.03 inches (0.8 millimeters) per year. In these images, orange
                and red shades indicate areas that lost ice mass, while light blue shades indicate areas that gained
                ice mass. White indicates areas where there has been very little or no change in ice mass since 2002
                Data from NASA's GRACE satellites, which measured Earth’s gravity field, show that the land ice sheets
                in both Antarctica (first chart) and Greenland (second chart) have been losing mass (ice) since 2002.
                Both ice sheets have seen an acceleration of ice mass loss since 2009.

                The latest research shows that Antarctic ice sheet losses are further accelerating, tripling their
                contribution
                to global sea level rise since 2012.

                Ice cores are scientists’ best source for historical climate data. Every winter, some snow coating
                Arctic and Antarctic ice sheets is left behind and compressed into a layer of ice. By extracting
                cylinders of ice from sheets thousands of meters thick, scientists can analyze dust, ash, pollen
                and bubbles of atmospheric gas trapped inside. The deepest discovered ice cores are an estimated
                800,000 years old. The particles trapped inside give scientists clues about volcanic eruptions,
                desert extent and forest fires. The presence of certain ions indicates past ocean activity,
                levels of sea ice and even the intensity of the Sun. The bubbles can be released to reveal the
                make-up of the ancient atmosphere, including greenhouse gas levels.

                Other tools for learning about Earth’s ancient atmosphere include growth rings in trees, which keep
                a rough record of each growing season’s temperature, moisture and cloudiness going back about 2,000
                years.
                Corals also form growth rings that provide information about temperature and nutrients in the tropical
                ocean.
                Other proxies, such as benthic cores, extend our knowledge of past climate back about a billion years
                into
                the past.

                The greenhouse effect is the way in which heat is trapped close to the surface of the Earth by
                “greenhouse gases.”
                These heat-trapping gases can be thought of as a blanket wrapped around the Earth, which keeps it
                toastier than
                it would be without them. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides.

                Greenhouse gases arise naturally, and are part of the make-up of our atmosphere. Earth is sometimes
                called the
                “Goldilocks” planet – it’s not too hot, not too cold, and the conditions are just right to allow life,
                including us, to flourish. Part of what makes Earth so amenable is the naturally-arising greenhouse
                effect,
                which keeps the planet at a friendly 15 °C (59 °F) on average. But in the last century or so, humans
                have
                been interfering with the energy balance of the planet, mainly through the burning of fossil fuels that
                give off additional carbon dioxide into the air. The level of carbon dioxide in Earth’s atmosphere has
                been rising consistently for decades and traps extra heat near the surface of the Earth, causing
                temperatures to rise.

                Yes and no. The ozone hole is basically a man-made hole in the ozone layer above the South Pole during
                the
                Southern Hemisphere’s spring. The ozone layer, which lies high up in the atmosphere, shields us from
                harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays that come from the Sun. Unfortunately we punched a hole in it, through
                the use of gases like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in spray cans and refrigerants, which break down
                ozone molecules in the upper atmosphere.
                While some extra of the Sun’s UV rays slip through the ozone hole, their net effect is to cool the
                stratosphere
                more than they warm the troposphere. So this increase in UV rays cannot explain the global warming of
                the
                planet's surface.

                What scientists have uncovered recently, however, is that the ozone hole has been affecting climate in
                the
                Southern Hemisphere. That’s because ozone is also a powerful greenhouse gas, and destroying it has made
                the stratosphere (the second layer of the atmosphere going upwards) over the Southern Hemisphere colder.
                The colder stratosphere has resulted in faster winds near the pole, which somewhat surprisingly can have
                impacts all the way to the equator, affecting tropical circulation and rainfall at lower latitudes.
                The ozone hole is not causing global warming, but it is affecting atmospheric circulation.

                Yes, the ocean is continuing to warm. Notably, all ocean basins have been experiencing significant
                warming
                since 1998, with more heat being transferred deeper into the ocean since 1990.

                To date, the ocean contains 93 percent of the heat from human-induced global warming, and the year
                2017 was the global ocean’s warmest year ever measured.

                Yes, evidence shows warming from 1998 to the present, with the four most recent years
                (2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017) being the four warmest years globally since 1880.

                Some people say “weather is what you get” and “climate is what you expect.” “Weather” refers to the more
                local changes in the climate we see around us, on short timescales from minutes to hours to days to
                weeks.
                Examples are familiar – rain, snow, clouds, winds, thunderstorms, heat waves and floods.
                “Climate” refers to longer-term averages (they may be regional or global), and can be thought of as
                the weather averaged over several seasons, years or decades. Climate change is harder for us to
                get a sense of because the timescales involved are much longer, and the impact of climate changes
                can be less immediate. Examples of climate change include several drier-than-normal summers, a trend of,
                say, winters becoming milder from our grandparents’ childhood to our own, or variations in effects
                like El Niño or La Niña.
