<h2> Is the ozone hole causing climate change?</h2>


<pre>

    Yes and no. The ozone hole is basically a man-made hole in the ozone layer above the South Pole during the
    Southern Hemisphere’s spring. The ozone layer, which lies high up in the atmosphere, shields us from
    harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays that come from the Sun. Unfortunately we punched a hole in it, through
    the use of gases like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) in spray cans and refrigerants, which break down
    ozone molecules in the upper atmosphere.
    While some extra of the Sun’s UV rays slip through the ozone hole, their net effect is to cool the stratosphere
    more than they warm the troposphere. So this increase in UV rays cannot explain the global warming of the
    planet's surface.

    What scientists have uncovered recently, however, is that the ozone hole has been affecting climate in the
    Southern Hemisphere. That’s because ozone is also a powerful greenhouse gas, and destroying it has made
    the stratosphere (the second layer of the atmosphere going upwards) over the Southern Hemisphere colder.
    The colder stratosphere has resulted in faster winds near the pole, which somewhat surprisingly can have
    impacts all the way to the equator, affecting tropical circulation and rainfall at lower latitudes.
    The ozone hole is not causing global warming, but it is affecting atmospheric circulation.
