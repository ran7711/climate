        <p>A SINGLE, TORRENTIAL rainstorm one day in June. An unseasonably warm day in January. A cold snap in late April.
          The wind, sun, humidity, and all the other things we experience when we walk outside every day: that’s weather.</p>

        <p>Climate, scientists have long explained, is what you get when you mash together day after week after month after
          year of weather. Climate is the whole cloth woven together by individual threads of daily weather.</p>

        <p>For years, scientists have cautioned that weather can’t tell us about how the climate is changing.
          That 70-degree day in January? There are a whole pile of reasons that could have happened. Climate
          change, they’ve said, could be part of the equation, but our statistical techniques haven’t previously
          been finely enough tuned to pick out the direct influence on weather of human-caused global warming.</p>

        <p>But those days are over. Climate change has dug in its claws so thoroughly into the planet that its marks
        can be seen in any single day of global weather since 2012. A 6-year-old child, therefore, has never lived
          a day without feeling climate change’s influence.</p>

        <p>A climate scientist “could sit on the space station and look down at Earth and actually see the fingerprint
          of climate change on any given day” just by watching the global weather pattern, says Reto Knutti at the
          Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science at ETH Zurich and an author of the research, published in
          January in Nature Climate Change. “We’re so far into uncharted territory in terms of climate change that
          we can see things clearly now.”</p>
