                <p>Australia is being ravaged by the worst wildfires seen in decades, with large swaths of the country devastated since the fire season began in late July.

                    At least 28 people have died nationwide, and in the state of New South Wales (NSW) alone, more than 3,000 homes have been destroyed or damaged. State and federal authorities are struggling to contain the massive blazes, even with firefighting assistance from other countries, including the United States.
                    All this has been exacerbated by persistent heat and drought, and many point to climate change as a factor making natural disasters go from bad to worse.

                <hr>
                <p>Australia’s unprecedented bushfire crisis has unfolded in waves across the spring and summer, demanding coverage across many months that has encompassed a vast geographical area and has tried to make sense of dozens of interrelated narratives, from the personal stories of individuals caught in the disaster to the devastation of wildlife, social media misinformation and the overarching relevance of the climate crisis.</p>
                <h2>Where are the fires?</h2>
                <p>There have been fires in every Australian state, but New South Wales has been hardest hit.
                    Blazes have torn through bushland, wooded areas, and national parks like the Blue Mountains. Some of Australia's largest cities have also been affected, including Melbourne and Sydney -- where fires have damaged homes in the outer suburbs and thick plumes of smoke have blanketed the urban center. Earlier in December, the smoke was so bad in Sydney that air quality measured 11 times the "hazardous" level.
                    The fires range in area from small blazes -- isolated buildings or part of a neighborhood -- to massive infernos that occupy entire hectares of land. Some start and are contained in a matter of days, but the biggest blazes have been burning for months. In NSW alone, more than 100 fires are still burning.</p>

                <h3>What is causing the fires?</h3>
                <p>Each year there is a fire season during the Australian summer, with hot, dry weather making it easy for blazes to start and spread.
                    Natural causes are to blame most of the time, like lightning strikes in drought-affected forests. Dry lightning was responsible for starting a number of fires in Victoria's East Gippsland region in late December, which then traveled more than 20 kilometers (12.4 miles) in just five hours, according to state agency Victoria Emergency.
                    Humans can also be to blame. NSW police have charged at least 24 people with deliberately starting bushfires, and have taken legal action against 183 people for fire-related offenses since November, according to a police statement.</p>

                <h3>Why are the fires so bad?</h3>
                <p>Fire season in Australia is always dangerous -- the 2009 Black Saturday fires killed 173 people in Victoria, making it the deadliest bushfire disaster on record. But conditions have been unusually severe this year, fanning the flames and making firefighting conditions particularly difficult.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Australia is experiencing one of its worst droughts in decades -- the country's Bureau of Meteorology said in December that last spring was the driest on record. Meanwhile, a heatwave in December broke the record for highest nationwide average temperature, with some places sweltering under temperatures well above 40 degrees Celsius (about 113-120 degrees Fahrenheit).</li>
                    <li>Strong winds have also made the fires and smoke spread more rapidly, and have led to fatalities -- a 28-year-old volunteer firefighter died in NSW in December after his truck rolled over in high winds.</li>
                    <li>Experts say climate change has worsened the scope and impact of natural disasters like fires and floods -- weather conditions are growing more extreme, and for years, the fires have been starting earlier in the season and spreading with greater intensity.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>What has been the damage so far?</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Entire towns have been engulfed in flames, and residents across several states have lost their homes. The heaviest structural damage occurred in NSW, the country's most populated state, where 1,588 homes have been destroyed and over 650 damaged.</li>
                    <li>In total, more than 7.3 million hectares (17.9 million acres) have been burned across Australia's six states -- an area larger than the countries of Belgium and Denmark combined. The worst-affected state is NSW, with more than 4.9 million hectares (12.1 million acres) burned.</li>
                    <li>To put that into perspective, the 2019 Amazon rainforest fires burned more than 7 million hectares (about 17.5 million acres), according to Brazilian officials. In California, which is known for its deadly wildfires, just over 100,000 hectares (247,000 acres) burned in 2019, and about 404,680 hectares (1 million acres) in 2018.</li>

                            <p>A SINGLE, TORRENTIAL rainstorm one day in June. An unseasonably warm day in January. A cold snap in late April.
                                The wind, sun, humidity, and all the other things we experience when we walk outside every day: that’s weather.</p>

                            <p>Climate, scientists have long explained, is what you get when you mash together day after week after month after
                                year of weather. Climate is the whole cloth woven together by individual threads of daily weather.</p>

                            <p>For years, scientists have cautioned that weather can’t tell us about how the climate is changing.
                                That 70-degree day in January? There are a whole pile of reasons that could have happened. Climate
                                change, they’ve said, could be part of the equation, but our statistical techniques haven’t previously
                                been finely enough tuned to pick out the direct influence on weather of human-caused global warming.</p>

                            <p>But those days are over. Climate change has dug in its claws so thoroughly into the planet that its marks
                                can be seen in any single day of global weather since 2012. A 6-year-old child, therefore, has never lived
                                a day without feeling climate change’s influence.</p>

                            <p>A climate scientist “could sit on the space station and look down at Earth and actually see the fingerprint
                                of climate change on any given day” just by watching the global weather pattern, says Reto Knutti at the
                                Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science at ETH Zurich and an author of the research, published in
                                January in Nature Climate Change. “We’re so far into uncharted territory in terms of climate change that
                                we can see things clearly now.”</p>
