<h2> What’s the difference between climate change and global warming?</h2>


<pre>

    “Global warming” refers to the long-term warming of the planet. Global temperature shows a well-documented
    rise since the early 20th century and most notably since the late 1970s. Worldwide, since 1880 the average
    surface temperature has risen about 1 °C (about 2 °F), relative to the mid-20th-century baseline (of 1951-1980).
    This is on top of about an additional 0.15 °C of warming from between 1750 and 1880.

    “Climate change” encompasses global warming, but refers to the broader range of changes that are happening to our
    planet. These include rising sea levels; shrinking mountain glaciers; accelerating ice melt in Greenland,
    Antarctica and the Arctic; and shifts in flower/plant blooming times. These are all consequences of the warming,
    which is caused mainly by people burning fossil fuels and putting out heat-trapping gases into the air.
    The terms “global warming” and “climate change” are sometimes used interchangeably, but strictly they refer
    to slightly different things.
