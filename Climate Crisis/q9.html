<h2> Is the ocean continuing to warm?</h2>


<pre>

    Yes, the ocean is continuing to warm. Notably, all ocean basins have been experiencing significant warming
    since 1998, with more heat being transferred deeper into the ocean since 1990.

    To date, the ocean contains 93 percent of the heat from human-induced global warming, and the year
    2017 was the global oceanâ€™s warmest year ever measured.
