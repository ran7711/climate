<p> Responding to Climate Change
    NASA is a world leader in climate studies and Earth science. While its role is not to set climate policy or
    prescribe particular responses or solutions to climate change,
    its purview does include providing the robust scientific data needed to understand climate change. NASA then makes
    this information available to the global community
    – the public, policy- and decision-makers and scientific and planning agencies around the world.

<p>Climate change is one of the most complex issues facing us today. It involves many dimensions – science, economics,
    society, politics and moral and ethical questions – and is a global problem, felt on local scales, that will be
    around for decades and centuries to come. Carbon dioxide, the heat-trapping greenhouse gas that has driven recent
    global warming, lingers in the atmosphere for hundreds of years, and the planet (especially the oceans) takes a
    while to respond to warming. So even if we stopped emitting all greenhouse gases today, global warming and climate
    change will continue to affect future generations. In this way, humanity is “committed” to some level of climate
    change.

    How much climate change? That will be determined by how our emissions continue and also exactly how our climate
    system responds to those emissions. Despite increasing awareness of climate change, our emissions of greenhouse
    gases continue on a relentless rise. In 2013, the daily level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere surpassed 400
    parts per million for the first time in human history. The last time levels were that high was about three to five
    million years ago, during the Pliocene Epoch.

    Because we are already committed to some level of climate change, responding to climate change involves a
    two-pronged approach:
    1. Reducing emissions of and stabilizing the levels of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere
    (“mitigation”);
    2. Adapting to the climate change already in the pipeline (“adaptation”)
