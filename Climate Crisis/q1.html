<h2> What do volcanoes have to do with climate change?</h2>


<pre>

    Overall, volcanoes release less than 2 percent of the equivalent amount of CO2 released by human activities.
    Quite small. However, about once every 20 years there is a volcanic eruption (e.g., Mount Pinatubo, El Chichon)
    that throws out a tremendous amount of particles and other gases. These will effectively shield us enough from
    the Sun to lead to a period of global cooling. The particles and gases typically dissipate after about 2 years,
    but the effect is nearly global.
