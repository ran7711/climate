       Ninety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that human activity is driving a climate crisis
        all across the Earth.

        We know it’s happening, and we know why: carbon pollution from fossil fuels is warming our planet and
        throwing natural systems out of balance.
    
       You don’t have to look far to see the results. Hotter temperatures, stronger storms, rising seas,
       and so much more, threatening the health of our families and the future we pass on to generations to come.
    
       What can we do? Shift from dirty fossil fuels to affordable clean energy sources like wind and solar.
    
       The good news is clear majorities of Americans and people around the world are ready to leave fossil
       fuels behind and create a sustainable future together. The tools and technology to do it are here today.
    
       The choice is ours. We can solve this crisis. We can power our lives and economies without
       destroying our planet. But we have to act now.
