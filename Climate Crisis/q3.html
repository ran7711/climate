<h2> Do scientists agree on climate change?</h2>


<pre>

    yes, the vast majority of actively publishing climate scientists – 97 percent – agree that humans are
    causing global warming and climate change. Most of the leading science organizations around the world
    have issued public statements expressing this, including international and U.S. science academies,
    the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and a whole host of reputable scientific
    bodies around the world.
