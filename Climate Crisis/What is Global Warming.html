    Weather refers to atmospheric conditions that occur locally over short periods of time—from minutes to hours or days. Familiar examples
    include rain, snow, clouds, winds, floods or thunderstorms.

    Climate, on the other hand, refers to the long-term regional or even global average of temperature, humidity and
    rainfall patterns over seasons, years or decades.

<p>
    Global warming is the long-term heating of Earth’s climate system observed since the pre-industrial period (between 1850 and 1900) due to human activities,
    primarily fossil fuel burning, which increases heat-trapping greenhouse gas levels in Earth’s atmosphere. The term is frequently used interchangeably with
    the term climate change, though the latter refers to both human- and naturally produced warming and the effects it has on our planet. It is most commonly
    measured as the average increase in Earth’s global surface temperature.

Since the pre-industrial period, human activities are estimated to have increased Earth’s global average temperature by about 1 degree Celsius (1.8 degrees Fahrenheit),
    a number that is currently increasing by 0.2 degrees Celsius (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade. Most of the current warming trend is extremely likely
    (greater than 95 percent probability) the result of human activity since the 1950s and is proceeding at an unprecedented rate over decades to millennia.

<h2>The biggest emitters are China and the US</h2>

<p>The countries emitting the most greenhouse gases by quite a long way are China and the US. Together they account for more than 40% of the global total,
    according to 2017 data from the European Commission's Joint Research Centre and PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.</p>
