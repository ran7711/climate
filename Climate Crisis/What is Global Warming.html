<p> Weather refers to atmospheric conditions that occur locally over short periods of timeâ€”from minutes to hours or days. Familiar examples include rain, snow, clouds, winds, floods or thunderstorms.

    Climate, on the other hand, refers to the long-term regional or even global average of temperature, humidity and rainfall patterns over seasons, years or decades. </p>
