<h2>Terrifying proof of global warming</h2>

<p>A SINGLE, TORRENTIAL rainstorm one day in June. An unseasonably warm day in January. A cold snap in late April.
    The wind, sun, humidity, and all the other things we experience when we walk outside every day: that’s weather.</p>


<p>Climate, scientists have long explained, is what you get when you mash together day after week after month after
    year of weather. Climate is the whole cloth woven together by individual threads of daily weather.</p>


<p>For years, scientists have cautioned that weather can’t tell us about how the climate is changing.
    That 70-degree day in January? There are a whole pile of reasons that could have happened. Climate
    change, they’ve said, could be part of the equation, but our statistical techniques haven’t previously
    been finely enough tuned to pick out the direct influence on weather of human-caused global warming.</p>


<p>But those days are over. Climate change has dug in its claws so thoroughly into the planet that its marks
    can be seen in any single day of global weather since 2012. A 6-year-old child, therefore, has never lived
    a day without feeling climate change’s influence.</p>


<p>A climate scientist “could sit on the space station and look down at Earth and actually see the fingerprint
    of climate change on any given day” just by watching the global weather pattern, says Reto Knutti at the
    Institute for Atmospheric and Climate Science at ETH Zurich and an author of the research, published in
    January in Nature Climate Change. “We’re so far into uncharted territory in terms of climate change that
    we can see things clearly now.”</p>

<h2>Great Pacific Garbage Patch</h2>



    <p>The Great Pacific Garbage Patch is a collection of marine debris in the North Pacific Ocean. Also known as
    the Pacific trash vortex, the garbage patch is actually two distinct collections of debris bounded by the
    massive North Pacific Subtropical Gyre.</p>

<p>It is estimated that 1.15 to 2.41 million tonnes of plastic are entering the ocean each year from rivers.
    More than half of this plastic is less dense than the water, meaning that it will not sink once it encounters the sea.
    1.15 TO 2.41 MILLION METRIC TONNES OF PLASTIC ARE ENTERING THE OCEAN EACH YEAR.
    </p>


   <p> The stronger, more buoyant plastics show resiliency in the marine environment, allowing
    them to be transported over extended distances. They persist at the sea surface as they
       make their way offshore, transported by converging currents and finally accumulating in the patch. </p>

   <p> Once these plastics enter the gyre, they are unlikely to leave the area until they degrade
    into smaller microplastics under the effects of sun, waves and marine life. As more and more
    plastics are discarded into the environment, microplastic concentration in the Great Pacific
    Garbage Patch  will only continue to increase.</p>
